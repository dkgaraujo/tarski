# Tarski

This repo contains the results of the following exercise where I ask OpenAI Codex to:

- formalise the proof of Tarski's theorem in Lean4 until it compiles,

- document the proof with comments, and

- describe the theorem, the Lean4 proof and the AI's experience writing the proof in a quarto markdown file, to be rendered into HTML.

I did very little on the *content* itself, just laid back and enjoyed seeing this live. Comments and feedback on both the experience & the content are very welcome!
